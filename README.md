Tic-Tac-Toe

Environment : linux (bash on windows)
Language : python3.5
module used : json, tkinter

Description :
    Trained using Q-Learning
    Binary representation :
        two bit to one space (00:blank, 01:O, 10:X)
    Number of states minimized to improve performance
    Workflow optimized
    Most states converged after 50000 round of training (jumpProb : 1 => 0)

used printState(state), getMinState(state), switchSide(state) to translate into game grid
